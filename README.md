**Hypothesis Testing Checkpoint

This checkpoint is designed to test your understanding of the content from the Hypothesis Testing Cumulative Lab.

Specifically, this will cover:

Identifying the null and alternative hypotheses

Identifying Type I and Type II errors in this context
**Calculating a z-score test 

Determining whether we can reject the null hypothesis based on this test statistic
Your Task: Identifying Likely New Species
**Business Understanding

You are working for a natural resources ecology laboratory, with the goal of identifying new species of salamander. If a salamander sample seems to have different attributes than a similar, known species, then the laboratory can perform genetic testing to confirm the difference. This genetic testing is expensive, so they only want to use it when we have a statistically significant reason to believe that the sample is from a new species.

Before conducting genetic testing, they want evidence that the sample is drawn from a different population than the known species â€” some unknown species. They are willing to conduct unnecessary genetic testing (where it turns out that the sample is actually from the known species) 20% of the time.

In other words, we will be using an 80% significance level, i.e. 
.

We have a new sample, and we want to know whether the sample is drawn from a population that is smaller in length than the known species.

**Data Understanding
You are provided with:

The mean length of the known species is 90mm. This is also known as 
, the theoretical mean.
The standard deviation of the known species length is 30mm. This is also known as 
 (sigma).
The mean length of the salamander sample is 87mm. This is also known as 
, or sample mean.
The sample contains 60 salamanders.
**Requirements

1. Identify Null and Alternative Hypotheses
2. Identify Type I and Type II Errors
3. Calculate the z-score Test Statistic
4. Determine Whether We Can Reject the Null Hypothesis
